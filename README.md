Lumbra is a strategy board game that explores the philosophical, artistic, and mechanical interplay between illumination and shadow. 
Inspired by ancient technologies and metaphors, the game is designed as a fusion of physical gameplay and 
optical manipulation, where victory is determined not just by movement, but by how light and shadow shape the board.
